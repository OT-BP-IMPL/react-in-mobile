# React in Web App 

Ever wanted to build a React app, bundle it and run it locally on a mobile device? This is a project for you! Often at [Ditto](https://www.ditto.live), we have customers who simply can't port a ton of code to SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose or have the know-how to wrangle React Native. Sometimes, a good old single-page web app will do the job. But what if you don't have any internet? This project will show you how you can build the app 

## Prerequites
